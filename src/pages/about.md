# ReadMe

Hello! I'm Tarun Chawla, a programming student from India, currently studying in Canada. In my spare time, you'll find me learning new tech, making projects or reading books.

What began as a hobbyist's interest in programming quickly evolved into a passionate career choice for me. The satisfaction and sense of accomplishment that I derive from solving complex problems and crafting efficient solutions are simply unparalleled.

I have honed my skills and gained proficiency in a variety of technologies, including:

- Python
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- JavaScript
- React
- Redux
- Django
- Many More

Programming for me is not just about writing code, but also about creating meaningful, impactful, and efficient solutions. I look forward to continuing my learning journey and making significant contributions to the world of programming.
